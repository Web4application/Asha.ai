:Description: Asha is an — Speech-to-Speech AI
---

Asha is a real-time, voice# #-native artificial intelligence system built for
continuous, natural, speech-to-speech conversation.

Asha listens, understands, thinks, and speaks — without relying on text input,
screens, or manual triggers.

> If it doesn’t listen first, it isn’t Asha.

## Core Capabilities
- 🎙️ Continuous microphone listening
- 📝 Speech-to-Text (STT)
- 🧠 Conversational reasoning
- 🗣️ Natural Text-to-Speech (TTS)
- 🔁 Persistent conversation loop

---

## Philosophy
Voice is the **primary interface**, not an add-on.
Asha is designed to feel alive, responsive, and huma-like.

# Architecture

Asha uses a modular, pipeline-based architecture.

## High-Level Flow

🎤 Audio Input → 📝 STT → 🤖 Reasoning → 🗣️ TTS → 🔊 Audio Output

## Modules
- Audio Engine
- Speech Recognition
- Intelligence Core
- Speech Synthesis
- Session Controller

Each module can be replaced or extended independently.

# Installation

## Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- Microphone access
- Audio output device

## Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Web4application/asha.git
cd asha
```

# 🔧 4. Configuration

### `Configuration.md`

```md
# Configuration

Asha is configured using environment variables or config files.

## Common Settings
- STT provider
- TTS provider
- Language
- Audio device
- Response latency

## Example
```env
ASHA_LANGUAGE=en
ASHA_STT=whisper
ASHA_TTS=coqui
```

# ▶️ 5. Usage

### `Usage.md`

```md
# Usage

Once started, Asha immediately begins listening.

## Basic Commands
- "stop listening"
- "pause"
- "resume"
- "shutdown"

Asha responds verbally and maintains conversational context.
 * * 1. 
## # Conversation Loop

Asha runs a continuous, non-blocking voice loop.

## Loop Steps
1. Detect voice activity
2. Capture audio stream
3. Transcribe speech
4. Generate response
5. Speak response
6. Resume listening

Speech can be interrupted at any time.

### Audio Pipeline

## Input
- Microphone stream
- Voice Activity Detection (VAD)

## Output
- Real-time playback
- Interruptible speech
- Low latency buffering

## Modes
- Streaming audio
- Chunked audio
# API Reference

Asha exposes internal APIs for integration.

## Core Interfaces
- AudioInput
- SpeechToText
- Brain
- TextToSpeech

## Example
```python
response = asha.process(audio_chunk)
```

# System Prompts

## Core Prompt
You are Asha, a real-time speech-to-speech AI.
You listen before responding.
You speak naturally and concisely.
You never reference text, screens, or reading.
You behave like a conversational presence.

## Response Style
- Short
- Natural
- Spoken language
- No narration
# Testing

## Audio Test
- Speak normally
- Check transcription accuracy
- Validate response timing

## Latency Test
- Measure STT time
- Measure TTS delay
- Optimize buffer size

# Roadmap

## Planned
- Streaming STT/TTS
- Wake-word detection
- Emotion-aware speech
- Long-term memory
- Multi-language support
- Web & mobile UI
```
# FAQ

## Is Asha offline?
Yes, depending on STT/TTS configuration.

## Is Asha always listening?
Yes, unless paused or shut down.

## Can Asha be embedded?
Yes. Asha is designed for system-level integration.
